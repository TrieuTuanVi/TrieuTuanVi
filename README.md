### WELCOME TO MY PAGE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student majoring in Data Science in Business, with a passion for analyzing data to solve real-world economic problems. Although I don't have much practical work experience, I have accumulated knowledge through academic projects, including big data analysis, predictive modeling, and business process optimization. I have an understanding of programming languages â€‹â€‹such as Python and R, and have used data analysis tools such as SQL and Tableau. I am looking for an internship or part-time job opportunity to further develop my skills and gain hands-on experience in this field.
